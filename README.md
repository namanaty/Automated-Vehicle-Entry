•The project provides a number plate character recognition system to enable automated access to vehicles.
•Configured the Raspberry Pi and camera to capture images when an object is detected nearby using an ultrasonic sensor. To identify whether the captured image is a vehicle, it is compared to a vehicle database.
•Used Python OpenCV libraries to detect number plate borders of the automobile and PyTesseract OCR engine to recognize characters from number plates to provide access.
